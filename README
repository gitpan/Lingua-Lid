Perl Extension "Lingua::Lid"
============================

The Perl extension "Lingua::Lid" provides a Perl interface to Lingua-Systems'
language and character encoding identification library "lid".

The interface is implemented using the XS language and makes the
functionality of the "lid" C library functions available to Perl applications
and modules in a simple to use way.


INSTALLATION

The build script will try to automatically determine the installation base
path of the "lid" C library.

In case you installed "lid" to a custom path, set the environment variable
LID_BASE_DIR accordingly before running Makefile.PL.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


DEPENDENCIES

 * Perl (>= 5.8.0)
 * lid  (>= 2.0.2)
   The C library is currently available for Linux, Solaris and FreeBSD.
